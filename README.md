# Getting Started with Create React App

# Task Manager React App

This is a simple **Task Manager** application built with **React**. It allows users to add, edit, complete, and delete tasks interactively using React's `useState` for state management.

---

## Features:
- **Add Tasks**: Users can input and add tasks to the list.
- **Mark Complete/Incomplete**: Tasks can be marked as completed or incomplete with a click.
- **Edit Tasks**: Users can edit existing tasks through an edit form.
- **Delete Tasks**: Tasks can be permanently removed.
- **Minimal UI**: Includes modern UI design with **FontAwesome** icons for edit and delete functionality, along with blur and transparency effects.

---

## Technologies:
- **React** for building interactive UIs.
- **useState** for managing state.
- **FontAwesome** for icons.
- **UUID** for generating unique task IDs.
- **CSS** for styling with modern visual effects.

---

## Project Structure:
- **`Todo.js`**: Displays an individual task with options to edit, complete, or delete.
- **`TodoForm.js`**: The form to add new tasks.
- **`TodoWrapper.js`**: Main component managing all tasks and their state.
- **`EditTodoForm.js`**: Form for editing existing tasks.












This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
